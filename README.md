## Charts Requirement

We would like to visualize various aspects of our cricket data to gain insights and understand the perfrormance of players and them combined as team. We have identified the following requirements for creating charts:

1. <ins>*Power Hitters*</ins> - Created a matrix for their name, team, batting style, innings batted, runs, balls faced, batting strike rate, batting average, batting position, boundary %. An area chart showing their performances like batting average, average balls faced, strike rate, boundary % in various matches. Also a scatter plot for tracking the top 5 players with taking strike rate and batting average into account.

2. <ins>*Anchors / Middle Order Batters*</ins> - Created a matrix for their name, team, batting style, innings batted, runs, balls faced, batting strike rate, batting average, batting position, boundary %. An area chart showing their performances like batting average, average balls faced, strike rate, boundary % in various matches. Also a scatter plot for tracking the top 5 players with taking strike rate and batting average into account.

3. <ins>*Finishers*</ins> - Created a matrix for their name, team, batting style, innings batted, runs, balls faced, batting strike rate, batting average, batting position, boundary %. An area chart showing their performances like batting average, average balls faced, strike rate, boundary % in various matches. Also a scatter plot for tracking the top 5 players with taking strike rate and batting average into account.
